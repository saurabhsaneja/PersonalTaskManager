IMPORTANT: Notification will be sent 1 minute prior to Task due date and time

Project Structure:
This project has 4 screens: Splash, Sign Up, Login and Home. In Home screen, use can view his todays and upcoming tasks. He can also update and delete his tasks. User would get notification 1 minute before task due date and time.

User can create and update task inside a model in Home screen.
I have implemented a button animation.
I have used zustand library for state management.
